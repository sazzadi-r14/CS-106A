Suppose Alice and Bob are US citizens and Alice sends an SMS message to Bob through Verizon.

1. If the police obtain a warrant and make a request to Verizon, can Verizon provide them with a copy of the message - yes or no? - one word answer: yes

2. Suppose instead Alice sends a message to Bob using an end-to-end encrypted messaging, and the bytes of the message flow through Verizon. Does Verizon have a copy of the plaintext of the message to provide to the police? Explain briefly.

Your answer: Verizon does not have a copy of the text to give to the police. Because end to end encrypted
text means, the data is encrypted from sender's device and is decrypted in the receivers device. But, any medium
in the middle is not supposed to be able to get the actual content. Because, even if they have access to the bytes
its encrypted, which can only be decrypted in the recievers device. So, verizon shouldn't be able to figure out 
the content of the message even if that passes through their service.
