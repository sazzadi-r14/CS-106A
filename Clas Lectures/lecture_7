#String
'''
len('') - this is a valid string and it is called the empty string. 
then len of it is 0
len basically gives how many chars(kars) are in the string. 

It is a convention to use ('') single quote for the string. 

How to get a indivudula char from the string?

You have to write the index number of the specific charracter in square brackets

function[i]

a = 'hi'
b = 'there'

a + b = hithere
the plus adds to strings together, it is called an concatenatinon

s = 'hello'
s = s + '!'
print(s) -- hello!

s += '!'
print(s) -- hello!
