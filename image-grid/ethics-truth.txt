For some assignments, we will have a short ethics exercise. Here is
the exercise that goes with the bluescreen project.

First, please watch the 7 minute video on Canvas from the ethics
staff.

With the bluescreen code, you've seen how to manipulate images.
You can imagine using these techniques to create images to
entertain or illustrate. And you can also imagine using these
techniques to mislead.

Write a paragraph below describing two hypothetical scenarios where
you use image manipulation - one benign and one harmful.
Explain why one is ethical and one is not.
Include this text file with your homework submission.

Scenario 1- For a research purpose where we are creating different 
kind of image mainpulation to check how human brain reacts to 
different kind of stimulus. How people periceive different picture
in their head and what kind of signals they give off. 

Scenario 2- Using it to decieve someone into something that's not true,
bending the reality, or manipulating someone to spread a propoganda.
